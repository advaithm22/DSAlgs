This repository will contain code for essential Data Structures, such as stacks, queues, heaps, linked lists, hash tables, tries, trees, and graphs. There will also be code for algorithms that can be incorporated to traverse certain data structures. To run files in your own virtual environment, use ipython (instructions coming soon)
